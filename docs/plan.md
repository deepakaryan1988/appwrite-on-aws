## ✅ DevOps Progress Summary – Day 7 & 8 (as of 2025-07-23)

### 🧱 What I’ve Done

1. **Created modular Terraform structure**:
   - `terraform/network` → VPC
   - `terraform/ecr` → ECR repos for appwrite, redis, mongodb
   - `terraform/secrets` → AWS Secrets Manager for Appwrite environment
   - `infra/` folder acts as master orchestration to apply/destroy all modules in one go

2. **Integrated AWS Secrets Manager securely via Terraform**
   - Stored essential env vars for Appwrite (DB host, Redis host, function settings, etc.)
   - Managed secrets via `map(string)` → `jsonencode()` pattern
   - Secrets named dynamically using `${var.project}-appwrite-env`

3. **Verified working apply/destroy lifecycle**
   - Clean `terraform apply` runs from `infra/`
   - Destroys entire stack with one command → cost control during learning

### 💬 Interview Talking Points

- **Modular Terraform Architecture**:  
  “I structured the infrastructure using Terraform modules and used a central infra orchestrator to manage everything.”

- **Cost-aware lifecycle automation**:  
  “To avoid AWS costs, I implemented full teardown at day-end and redeploy every morning using `terraform destroy` and `apply`.”

- **Secrets Manager integration**:  
  “Secrets were never hardcoded. I used Terraform to inject Appwrite env vars into AWS Secrets Manager and plan to inject those into ECS tasks.”

- **IAM Troubleshooting Experience**:  
  “Hit a `secretsmanager:CreateSecret` AccessDenied error. Diagnosed it, fixed via IAM policy, and re-ran Terraform — successful deployment.”

### ✅ Result:
Project is now ready for:
- ECS Task Definition with secret injection (Day 9)
- Appwrite container deployment on ECS Fargate
- Logging to CloudWatch and health check configuration
